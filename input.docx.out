{"assignment":["\nAssignment. Customer shall not assign or transfer Customers rights or obligations under this Agreement without Betas prior written consent. As used herein the term Assignment Conditions means that, in the case of any permitted assignment, Customer must provide Beta with written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of such assignment becoming effective, and if upon receipt of such notice Beta reasonably determines that the intended assigned: (i) is Betas competitor, (ii) is an entity that has failed or is unable or unwilling to protect Betas Confidential Information or intellectual property rights, (iii) does not possess sufficient financial or other resources to perform its obligations and/or (iv) refuses, within a reasonable time after Betas request, to sign an amended Agreement or other agreement with Beta assuming Customers obligations hereunder and, if required, to pay additional commercially reasonable fees. In all events, Customer shall remain liable for the acts and omissions of Customers permitted assignees until an amended Agreement or other agreement is entered into between Beta and Customers assignee."],"governinglaw":["\nMiscellaneous. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New Jersey without regard to principles of conflicts of laws. All claims or actions arising herefrom shall be brought in the appropriate court in the State of New Jersey, and Customer consents to personal jurisdiction and venue therein. This Agreement is the entire agreement of the parties with respect to Your possession and Use of the Analytics Tool, except if Customer has entered into a separate, valid and existing license agreement with Beta or any of Betas subsidiaries or affiliates, in which case that separate license agreement shall govern solely to the extent of any inconsistency with this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement is held unenforceable the enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not be affected. Article headings are used for convenience of reference only. This Agreement may only be modified by mutual written consent of the parties. The waiver by either party of any default or breach shall not constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent default or breach."],"limitation_of_liability":["\nLimitation on Liability. IN NO EVENT SHALL BETA, ITS AFFILIATES, ITS RESELLERS, LICENSORS OR SUPPLIERS, AS APPLICABLE, BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, RELIANCE OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR LOST OR IMPUTED PROFITS OR LOST DATA. BETAS AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO DIRECT DAMAGES IN AN AMOUNT NOT TO EXCEED THE FEES ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY BETA UNDER THE ORDER OUT OF WHICH THE CLAIM AROSE DURING THE TWELVE MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING ASSERTION OF THE CLAIM. THE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS SET FORTH IN THIS ARTICLE APPLY TO ALL CLAIMS OR CAUSES OF ACTION ON WHATEVER BASIS AND UNDER WHATEVER THEORY BROUGHT AND IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER THE PARTY AGAINST WHICH SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION IS ASSERTED HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH CLAIM. SOME STATES OR COUNTRIES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY."],"termination_for_cause":["\nTerm and Termination. Customers right to enter into Orders under this Agreement becomes effective on the Effective Date and continues until terminated or superseded as provided in this Article 11 (the Contract Term). By signing below, Customer acknowledges that the Contract Term is different from the License Term and that Customer may need to purchase renewal License rights prior to expiration of the Contract Term. In addition to the termination rights in clause (b) of Article 2, if an obligation hereunder is materially breached, the non-breaching party may provide written notice specifying the nature of the breach and the breaching party will have thirty (30) days (or twenty (20) days, in the case of payment-related claims pursuant to Article 4) from receipt of notice to cure. If not so cured, the non-breaching party may terminate the applicable Order or all Orders by providing a second written notice of immediate termination. In addition, all Orders, including all License rights under them, shall terminate automatically and immediately upon Customers insolvency or any attempt by Customer to obtain protection from creditors or wind down operations. Beta also may inform Customer at any time that this Agreement has been superseded by a new version. If this Agreement is superseded, all prior purchases will continue to be governed by the earlier version. If an Order is terminated by either party or expires pursuant to its terms, then Customer must (i) pay any outstanding amounts due to Beta, (ii) immediately discontinue all Use of the Analytics Tool and Documentation; and (iii) immediately return or destroy the Analytics Tool and Documentation (as determined by Beta) together with all copies, and certify to such return or destruction in writing. Upon any termination or expiration of this Agreement, Customer automatically forfeits all rights to receive Subsequent Upgrades to the Analytics Tool."]}
