Receiving Party may then disclose only so much of the Confidential Information as is legally required to be disclosed.e) Notwithstanding any provision in this Section 2 or these Terms and Conditions, each party acknowledges that the other may independently develop similar or competitive products, services, or information so long as it does not use the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information in the development thereof.f) Upon the Disclosing Party’s written request, Receiving Party will immediately either destroy all of Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information in its possession, including all copies and compilations thereof and provide an officer’s certificate confirming its destruction, or return all of Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information in its possession, including all copies and compilations thereof.g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2, this Agreement and all terms and provisions hereof, including any terms and conditions in the applicable marketplace and other ancillary instruments executed in connection with this Agreement, constitute the Confidential Information of each party.  3.
